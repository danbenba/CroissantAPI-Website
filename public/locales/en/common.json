  "index.about.system.title": "The Croissant Inventory System",
  "index.about.system.1": "The idea of Croissant Inventory System was to be a second-hand items marketplace crafted for gamers and creators. My platform not only allows players to exchange in-game items but also empowers creators to monetize their creations by selling items and cosmetics without any fees. This approach challenges the ultra-expensive marketplaces by providing a fair and accessible platform for all.",
  "index.about.system.2": "I am committed to giving items a second life, enabling seamless trading, buying, and selling of pre-owned items. This promotes sustainability and fosters a dynamic marketplace environment where gamers can benefit from each other's inventories.",
  "index.about.system.3": "Importantly, players do not need to be familiar with the bot or even have a Discord account to enjoy the benefits of my system. The Croissant Inventory System is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to all.",

  "index.about.api.title": "API & Discord Bot",
  "index.about.api.1": "I'm actively working on maintaining the API and the Discord bot to ensure they are stable and robust, minimizing the risk of bugs. The Discord bot, which facilitates inventory management and trading, is already available. You can explore it here.",

  "index.about.philosophy.title": "Marketplace Philosophy",
  "index.about.philosophy.1": "Like Vinted, the Croissant Inventory System was thinked to be an user-to-user marketplace. I'm working on it to make it as easy as possible to use for users, but also for creators.",
  "index.about.philosophy.2": "As both a gamer and developer, I've always dreamed of a marketplace that truly understands the gaming community's needs. That's why I built Croissant to be more than just a trading platform - it's a vibrant ecosystem where gaming items find new life and creators can thrive.",

  "index.about.gamers.title": "For Gamers",
  "index.about.gamers.1": "For gamers, I've witnessed firsthand how frustrating it can be to have valuable items sitting unused in your inventory. With Croissant, you can now turn these dormant assets into opportunities. Imagine finding that rare skin you've been hunting for months, or finally completing your collection by trading with someone across the globe. The possibilities are endless, and the best part? It's all happening in a secure, user-friendly environment.",

  "index.about.creators.title": "For Creators",
  "index.about.creators.1": "To my fellow creators out there - I understand the challenge of monetizing your creative work in a market dominated by high commission rates. That's why Croissant stands apart with our zero-fee policy. You pour your heart into designing unique items, and I believe you should keep every penny you earn. Whether you're creating custom skins, special items, or entire collections, Croissant gives you the platform to reach players directly and build your own community.",

  "index.about.simplicity.title": "Simplicity & Accessibility",
  "index.about.simplicity.1": "The magic of Croissant lies in its simplicity. You don't need to be a tech expert or even have a Discord account to get started as an user. I've designed the system to be as intuitive as possible, while still offering powerful features for those who want to dive deeper. From casual traders to serious collectors, from indie creators to established developers - there's a place for everyone in our ecosystem.",

  "index.about.future.title": "The Future",
  "index.about.future.1": "Looking ahead, I'm incredibly excited about the future of Croissant. We're working on features like cross-game trading, enhanced creator tools, and community events that will make the platform even more dynamic. Imagine being able to trade items across different games, or participating in special marketplace events where rare items become available. These aren't just plans - they're promises I'm committed to delivering.",

  "index.about.community.title": "Community",
  "index.about.community.1": "But what truly makes Croissant special is our community. Every day, I see players helping each other find items, creators sharing tips and resources, and new friendships forming through trades.
