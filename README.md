# ü•ê Croissant Ecosystem - Complete Inventory Management Platform and Marketplace

Croissant, developed by **Fox** (fox3000foxy), is an innovative French platform dedicated to virtual inventory management and the gaming marketplace. It offers a commission-free ecosystem, allowing creators to keep 100% of their revenue, while providing players with a simple and secure exchange space for their virtual items.

Croissant's goal is to build a fair and accessible marketplace where every virtual item can have a second life. The platform encourages sustainability, community exchanges, and the promotion of creations through a "second life" approach to digital objects.

The architecture is based on a robust REST API, multi-platform applications (web, desktop via Electron, Discord bot, responsive mobile), and easy integration for developers thanks to various SDKs (JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, PHP, Ruby, Rust, C++). Key features include advanced cross-game inventory management, an integrated marketplace, a secure trading system, synchronization with Steam, and powerful tools for creators (item creation, commission-free monetization, studio management).

For developers, Croissant offers a comprehensive API, multi-language SDKs, and easy-to-integrate OAuth2 authentication. Creators benefit from an intuitive interface for creating and managing their items, transparent monetization tools, and a team collaboration system.

Security is at the heart of the platform, with multiple authentication methods (passkeys, TOTP, OAuth, email), strict API key management, end-to-end encryption, and advanced monitoring. The monetary system is based on convertible and transferable Croissant Credits, with Stripe integration and multi-currency support.

Technically, Croissant relies on React/Next.js for the frontend, a relational database, WebSockets for real-time, a global CDN, and a powerful desktop launcher. The ecosystem includes more than 50 API endpoints, 7 SDKs, multi-game support, and guarantees high performance (<100ms latency, 99.9% uptime).

The use cases cover the needs of indie developers (fast integration, player rewards), studios (cross-game economy, analytics, monetization), and content creators (sales of skins, event items, limited collections).

Dedicated tools are offered: developer dashboard, OAuth2 management, interactive documentation, real-time analytics, and responsive technical support. Croissant stands out for its commission-free approach, openness, cross-game compatibility, enterprise-grade security, and ease of integration.

Croissant is reinventing the gaming marketplace with a community-centric approach, focused on fairness, ease of integration, and technical reliability. It's a modern, scalable, and open solution for managing and trading virtual items.
